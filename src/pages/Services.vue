Know more About SASHA
SASHA's legal professionals as External Member on the IC
The law mandates the presence of an External Member from an NGO dedicated to the cause of women or a person associated with or aware of issues pertaining to sexual harassment, on the Internal Committee of every organisation. SASHA’s legal professionals not only provide hand-holding support while conducting inquiries into complaints, but also ensure an unbiased procedure that is thoroughly documented.
Added is the creation of our robust redressal mechanism. By advising the employer about the best practices to create a safe, inclusive, respectable and trust-worthy work environment, we help build a safe space that enables employees to come forth and speak up confidently in case of any discomfort.
As external members, SASHA’s legal professionals also help draft the organisation's PoSH policy, conduct PoSH Audits and ensure legal compliance while helping to create safe and inclusive workplaces in every sense.
